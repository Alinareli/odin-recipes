    <p>Butter chicken, or murgh makhani, is a popular Indian dish featuring tender, marinated chicken simmered in a rich, creamy, and mildly spiced tomato-based gravy. It is characterized by its velvety texture, aromatic spices like garam masala and fenugreek, and a distinct buttery taste, usually served with naan or rice. </p>
